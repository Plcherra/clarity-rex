# Clarity Review Crew

A focused CrewAI team that **reviews** the Clarity codebase and can **optionally
fix** it. It has two modes.

**REVIEW mode (default — cheap, no file edits):**

1. **ProjectReader** — maps the code in scope: key files, responsibilities, how they connect.
2. **BugFinder** — hunts for real bugs, risks, and Clarity-rule violations (cites file:line).
3. **FixSuggester** — writes a concrete fix report to `clarity_review_report.md`.

**FIX mode (opt-in with `--fix` — edits files, one pass by default):**

4. **FixApplier** — applies each suggested fix, runs the closest tests, and marks each
   issue FIXED / REVERTED (reverts exactly if its tests fail).

The first three agents get **read-only** tools (`list_directory`, `read_file`,
`search_code`), sandboxed to the repo root. **FixApplier** additionally gets
`edit_file` (exact, unique-match, syntax-checked), `run_tests` (pytest via the
backend's own venv), and `restore_file` (byte-exact revert).

> 💸 **Cost warning:** FIX mode is much more expensive than REVIEW — it re-reads
> code and runs the model in a tool loop, and on already-clean code it often
> proposes marginal/no-op changes that then get reverted. **Start with REVIEW.**
> Only add `--fix` when you actually expect bugs, and keep the scope narrow.

> ⚠️ FIX mode edits your source files. **Run it on a clean git branch** and review
> the full diff (`git diff`). It will not run multiple passes unless you pass
> `--rounds N`.

## Setup

```powershell
cd crew
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env       # then edit .env and add your API key
```

By default it uses the cheap/fast **xAI Grok** model `xai/grok-3-mini` (add your
`XAI_API_KEY` from https://console.x.ai to `.env`).

The provider is **auto-detected from the `MODEL` string**, so you can switch
freely — just set `MODEL` and the matching key in `.env`:

| `MODEL` | Provider | Key needed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xai/grok-3-mini` | xAI | `XAI_API_KEY` | cheap/fast, but a reasoning model that can return empties |
| `xai/grok-3` | xAI | `XAI_API_KEY` | non-reasoning, steadier |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | cheap/fast and **most reliable inside CrewAI's tool loop** |
| `gpt-4o` | OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | strongest |

> If Grok keeps returning empty responses (see below), the simplest reliable fix
> is `MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set.

## Run

Recommended workflow — **review → prune → apply-only** — so you never pay to
apply fixes you don't want:

```powershell
# 1) REVIEW (default): read + find + suggest, NO edits. Cheap. Start here.
python clarity_crew.py services/rex-api/app/services/capabilities

# 2) Open crew/clarity_review_report.md and DELETE any fixes you don't want.

# 3) APPLY-ONLY: apply just the fixes left in the report (no re-analysis = cheap).
python clarity_crew.py services/rex-api/app/services/capabilities --apply-only
```

Or do it all in one shot (analyze + apply, one pass):

```powershell
python clarity_crew.py <path> --fix
python clarity_crew.py <path> --fix --rounds 3   # loop up to N passes (rarely needed)
```

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(none)* | REVIEW only — writes the report, edits nothing | on |
| `--fix` / `--apply` | analyze **and** apply (FixApplier edits files) | off |
| `--apply-only` | apply fixes from the existing report, skip analysis | off |
| `--rounds N` | max fix passes (only with `--fix`) | 1 |

### How the FixApplier decides (so tokens aren't wasted on reverts)

- **No-op / cosmetic / duplicate** suggestion → **SKIPPED** (never edited).
- Real fix, **tests pass** → kept, **FIXED**.
- Real fix, **no test covers it** → kept, **APPLIED-UNVERIFIED** (flagged for your
  review) — it is *not* thrown away just because there's no test.
- Real fix, **a test now fails** → the applier **iterates on the code to make it
  pass** (up to a few attempts; it never weakens/deletes tests). Green → **FIXED**.
  Only if it still can't → reverted byte-exact, **REVERTED** (last resort).

The review is always saved to `crew/clarity_review_report.md`. When applying,
FixApplier's results plus a **Ground truth** section (real edit count +
`git diff --stat`) are saved to `crew/clarity_fix_results.md`. For reliable edits
set `APPLIER_MODEL=gpt-4o`.

## Reliability (empty-response handling)

Grok reasoning models (`grok-3-mini`) sometimes return an empty completion —
CrewAI then raises `Invalid response from LLM call - None or empty`. The crew is
hardened against this via `grok_client.py`:

- **Retries up to 3 times** when Grok returns None/empty or the API errors out,
  with a short backoff **and escalating temperature** (0.1 → 0.5 → 0.9). The mini
  model is a reasoning model that occasionally emits only hidden reasoning with
  empty visible content; a plain retry at low temperature reproduces the same
  empty, so bumping temperature lets it take a different path.
- **Automatic fallback model**: if it still comes back empty, that single call is
  handed to `FALLBACK_MODEL`. If unset, it uses `gpt-4o-mini` when `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  is present, otherwise `xai/grok-3`. Set `FALLBACK_MODEL=none` to disable.
- **Smaller context**: file reads are capped (`READ_MAX_CHARS`, default 16k) so a
  few large files don't blow up the context and trigger empty Grok responses.
- **Lower `TEMPERATURE` (0.1)** for steadier output, **`MAX_TOKENS` cap (4000)**,
  and **`REASONING_EFFORT=low`** to reduce rate-limit pressure and wasted reasoning.
- If a run *still* fails after retries and fallback, the crew **doesn't crash with
  a raw traceback** — it logs a clear message and appends a "Run error" note to
  `clarity_fix_results.md`, keeping any edits already applied.

Want maximum reliability from the start? Set `MODEL=xai/grok-3` (non-reasoning) in `.env`.

## Notes

- **REVIEW is the default** and by far the cheapest, most useful mode — the report
  is the main value. Only reach for `--fix` when you expect real, fixable bugs.
- Scoping to one folder keeps token usage (and cost) low and each pass fast.
- FIX mode **modifies your code**. Use a clean git branch and review with `git diff`.
- FIX mode runs a **single pass** unless you pass `--rounds N` — it will not silently
  loop and burn tokens re-analyzing clean code.
