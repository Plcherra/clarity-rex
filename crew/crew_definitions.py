"""Agent and task definitions for the Clarity Review Crew.

Kept separate from the orchestrator (clarity_crew.py) so each file stays small
and focused. Agents/tasks here are deliberately biased toward HIGH-VALUE, real
fixes: the crew should only spend tokens on changes worth keeping, never on
speculative churn that gets reverted.

# Shared policy the FixApplier follows in both full-fix and apply-only modes.
# The guiding rule: only revert a change that a test proves is a REGRESSION.
# Never waste a run reverting good work.
_APPLIER_POLICY = (
    "For EACH suggested fix:\n"
    "1. Re-read the target file to confirm the exact current code.\n"
    "2. FIRST decide if the fix actually changes runtime behavior. If it is a "
    "no-op, cosmetic, or duplicates logic that already exists, SKIP it (mark "
    "SKIPPED) — do not edit. We do not want pointless changes.\n"
    "3. Apply a real fix with edit_file (focused, exact, no whole-file rewrites). "
    "If edit_file REJECTS it for breaking syntax, do NOT resubmit the same text — "
    "re-read, copy the exact indentation, and change your new_string first.\n"
    "4. Run ONLY the closest relevant test file with run_tests (not the whole "
    "suite; unrelated pre-existing failures must not block you).\n"
    "5. Decide the outcome:\n"
    "   - Tests PASS  -> keep the change, mark FIXED (verified).\n"
    "   - Tests FAIL -> the fix is NOT finished. Do NOT revert yet. Read the "
    "failure, diagnose the real cause, and IMPROVE the code (adjust your change or "
    "add the necessary companion change), then re-run the closest test. Try up to "
    "3 attempts to get it green. NEVER weaken, skip, or delete a test to force a "
    "pass — fix the real code. If it goes green -> mark FIXED. Only if it still "
    "fails after your attempts -> restore_file to revert everything you changed for "
    "this issue, mark REVERTED, and move on (do not get stuck).\n"
    "   - No test exercises this code -> KEEP the change, mark "
    "APPLIED-UNVERIFIED (needs human review). Do NOT revert just because there is "
    "no test.\n"
