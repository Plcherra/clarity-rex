# Permanent Workflow Cleanup Plan

Historical plan from the pre-Supabase cleanup. `AppState` has since been
deleted. Current wiring lives in `AppComposition`; table data operations go
through Supabase services.

Use this plan before auth and API key work. The goal is to make extracted
services permanent, not temporary routes back into old helpers.

## Phase 1 - Account Workflow

- [x] Move `deleteAccountWorkflow` out of `AccountService`.
- [x] Create `lib/features/accounts/application/account_workflow_service.dart`.
- [x] Keep `AccountService` focused on account state and persistence.
- [x] Wire UI account deletion to `AccountWorkflowService`.
- [x] Remove AppState account deletion coordination.
- [x] Verify with `dart analyze` and focused tests.

Completed: added `AccountWorkflowService` for account deletion coordination.
`AccountService` now only removes and persists the account row plus transaction
map slice, while the workflow service updates transaction metadata and refreshes
state. `AppState` creates the account workflow service and no longer exposes
`deleteAccount`.

## Phase 2 - Budget Workflow

- [x] Move `setActiveBudgetPeriod` coordination out of `AppState`.
- [x] Move `commitBudgetDraft` coordination out of `AppState`.
- [x] Create `lib/features/budgets/application/budget_workflow_service.dart`.
- [x] Keep `BudgetService` focused on budget state and persistence.
- [x] Wire budget UI mutations to `BudgetWorkflowService`.
- [x] Verify with `dart analyze` and focused tests.

Completed: added `BudgetWorkflowService` for budget period selection and budget
draft commits. `AppState` creates the workflow service and no longer exposes
budget mutation methods. `BudgetUiController` now delegates budget mutations to
the workflow service directly.

## Phase 3 - Startup Hydration

- [x] Move startup hydration order out of `AppState`.
- [x] Keep existing service hydration methods in their feature services.
- [x] Create or expand an app-level startup coordinator.
- [x] Make `bootstrap()` call the startup coordinator instead of many AppState
      hydration delegates.
- [x] Verify with `dart analyze` and focused tests.

Completed: added `AppStartupService` for startup hydration order and deleted the
old `app_hydration.dart` wrapper. `AppState` no longer exposes individual
startup hydration delegates. `bootstrap()` now calls
`appState.startupService.hydrateForStartup()`.

## Phase 4 - Refresh Permanence

- [x] Keep `DashboardRefreshCoordinator` temporarily as app-level coordination.
- [x] Audit every `refreshAllState()` caller.
- [ ] Replace broad refresh calls with scoped controller/service refreshes where
      practical.
- [x] Remove `refreshAllState()` from public AppState usage.

Completed: `DashboardRefreshCoordinator` now owns the refresh-and-notify path.
Workflow services receive the coordinator callback directly, tests call the
coordinator instead of `AppState.refreshAllState()`, and `AppState` no longer
exposes a public refresh delegate. Broad refresh remains centralized in the
coordinator until scoped controller refreshes are designed.

## Phase 5 - Profile/Auth Boundary

- [x] Keep `localProfile`, `setLocalProfile`, and onboarding routing until auth
      starts.
- [ ] Move session/profile state into auth/profile controllers during auth work.
- [x] Stop passing full `AppState` into onboarding; use narrow callbacks until
      auth/profile has a permanent owner.

Completed: `OnboardingScreen` no longer imports or receives full `AppState`.
It accepts only a `saveLocalProfile` callback and `AppUiDependencies` for the
post-onboarding shell route. Full auth/session ownership is intentionally left
for the auth feature.
